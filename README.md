Mapping the distribution of dark matter to stellar mass and galaxies. 


## Methodology

### 1. Download density field arrays. 
	See dat/illustris-data

### 2. Generate sub-fields.
	See dat/reconstruction-data

### 3. Train model(s) 
	See src/

### 4. Compute cosmological statistics
	See src/


Current methods include visualization of test subcube demonstrating model reconstruction capabilities, summary statistics,train loss curve, power spectrums, predicted vs target mass distribution, and more.
